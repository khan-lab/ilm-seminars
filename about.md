## Summary

The **ILM Seminar Series** (Informatics for Life and Medicine) is a new initiative at **MBZUAI** designed to foster scientific discussion and collaboration at the intersection of **computational biology, artificial intelligence, and systems medicine**. The name **“ILM”** is inspired by the Arabic word _‘ilm'_ (علم), meaning _knowledge_, reflecting the series’ mission to cultivate interdisciplinary understanding and regional leadership at the intersection of biology and AI.

As MBZUAI expands its research portfolio in precision medicine, public health, and AI for health, ILM will serve as a flagship seminar series welcoming **international** and **emerging regional** scientists. The series promotes cutting-edge research and provides a visible platform for **early-career researchers** in the country.

Each ILM session is structured to maximize scientific exchange and community engagement. Sessions open with a **10-minute trainee spotlight** by a local PhD student or postdoctoral researcher, followed by a **35-minute keynote** and a **15-minute Q&A**. To encourage informal interaction, each session concludes with **community networking**, allowing students and faculty to meet the speaker in a relaxed setting over refreshments. Interested faculty and trainees will also be encouraged to meet with the guest speaker through short **1:1 meetings**. The format emphasizes visibility for local talent, mentorship, and practice in science communication. By bringing together international experts and local talent, the ILM seminar series aims to position **MBZUAI** and **Abu Dhabi** as a leading node in the global network of **bio-AI** innovation.

## ILM’s mission

To advance local scientific knowledge and collaboration by hosting scientists in **data-driven biology and medicine** while providing a platform for **local trainees and faculty** to engage, learn, and grow.

## Objectives
